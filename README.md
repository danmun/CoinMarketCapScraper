# CoinMarketCapScraper
Scraper for pulling detailed cryptocurrency information from CoinMarketCap.com.

At the moment, the HTML version of CoinMarketCap provides a lot more information about coins and markets than the API.
This scraper will allow programmatic access to coin info which is not available in the API. 
For example, websites, chats and social media related to the coin, as well as the exchanges it's available on and the statistics for each
market it facilitates.

The scraper will also allow access to 7 day charts, and trending coins.
